## Who am I?

Hello, my name is Ali Keramati, and I am a Ph.D. student in Educational Data Science. I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Tehran in 2024. 

<!-- I previously earned a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering with a minor in Educational Sciences from the University of Tehran. I proudly served as an undergraduate research assistant at several research labs, including the Cognitive Systems Lab, Technology Enhanced Learning Lab (TELAB), UT NLP Group, National Brain Centre, the University of Queensland (remotely), and the Embodied Design Research Lab at UC Berkeley (remotely). -->

<!-- Through my experiences as a student, teacher, and teaching assistant in academia, I noticed several challenges faced by both students and teachers that technology could address. These experiences shaped my long-term goal: **to utilize technology, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI), to achieve substantial improvements in learning, teaching, and assessment.** -->

## Research Interests


<!-- My research explores the intersection of artificial intelligence, cognition, and education. I am deeply interested in the **cognitive evaluation** of large language models (LLMs), focusing on assessing their interpretability, reasoning abilities, learning processes, and educational impact. Additionally, I design **multi-agent** LLM systems to support cognitive and educational tasks, aiming to create adaptive and personalized learning environments. Through this interdisciplinary lens, I aim to develop LLM-driven tools that enhance learning experiences while fostering more effective human-AI collaboration in education. -->

My research bridges artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and education, with a focus on developing human-centered AI systems. I investigate the cognitive capabilities of large language models (LLMs), examining their interpretability, reasoning dynamics, and learning processes to design systems that have meaningful educational impact.

I explore machine learning and natural language processing methods to enhance student learning experiences and support more effective teaching practices. Specifically, I investigate the application of LLMs in combination with optimization techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), fine-tuning, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). I am mainly utilizing LLMs and optimizing them within a multi-agent framework to create systems aimed at delivering personalized learning experiences.

By integrating learning analytics, human–AI interaction, and computational models of human cognition, I aim to advance both the scientific understanding of cognition in LLMs and the practical design of next-generation learning technologies.

<!-- My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, cognition, and education, particularly in the development of advanced **machine learning** and **natural language processing** methods to enhance student learning experiences and support more effective teaching practices.

In addition to my computational interests, I am eager to work as a **digital learning designer**. I aspire to integrate my developed models into real-world classroom settings to test their effectiveness within innovative, digitalized teaching approaches. My background in learning design and research in collaborative learning fuels my passion for computer-supported collaborative learning **(CSCL)**, and I am excited to create and implement models that facilitate productive collaboration among learners. As I continue to learn and grow, I am excited to bridge the gap between technology and education, creating innovative solutions that make learning effective, accessible, and engaging for all.

Additionally, I am interested in exploring philosophical and psychological questions at the intersection of **human cognition** and LLMs, analyzing how human learning, knowledge organization, and memory compare to LLM-driven processes. Ultimately, I aim to design and benchmark **LLM-powered tools**—such as chatbots and automated educational systems—that align closely with human cognitive processes, improving educational outcomes and transforming how people learn and teach. -->

## Other Interests

In addition to my passion for technology, I have a deep love for the arts. From painting and music to movies and theater, I find inspiration in various creative forms. Movies and series captivate me, painting is my outlet for creativity, and music fuels my focus. Last summer, I delved into the world of acting and film direction in a school theater named [Tazeh Theater](https://www.instagram.com/tazeh_theater/?hl=en), enhancing my understanding of cinematic storytelling. As a former and retired soccer player for [Esteghlal F.C. U17](https://www.transfermarkt.com/esteghlal-fc-u17/startseite/verein/88915), I continue my passion for the sport and occasionally join friends on the field.
